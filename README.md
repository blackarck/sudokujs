# Javascript Implementation of Sudoku

This program fills the 9\*9 grid with valid sudoku numbers. 2 dimension arrays play an important role in most 2d games. Sudoku is no exception, consider it as tiles which needs to fill up the screen at valid position. We pick a box try to insert a number there, run all the rules, if it works good if not try the next number. Heart of this program is file sudokucode.js. Future state of project describe in project status.

In version 2.0 backend was added which will let a user login, save and load a previous saved game. This is starting of bigger picture where a multiplayer competitive game would be enabled.
