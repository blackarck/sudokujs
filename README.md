# Javascript Implementation of Sudoku

This program fills the 9*9 grid with valid sudoku numbers. 2 dimension arrays play an important role in most 2d games. Sudoku is no exception, consider it as tiles which needs to fill up the screen at valid position. We pick a box try to insert a number there, run all the rules, if it works good if not try the next number. Heart of this program is file sudokucode.js. Feel free to fork the repo
